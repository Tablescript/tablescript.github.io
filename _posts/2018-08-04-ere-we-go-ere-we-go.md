Tablescript.js is live!

Well, it's at least partly live. The [documentation](/docs) will grow over time. The [fiddle tool](/fiddle) will grow into an archive of cloud-stored shared tables. I have plans.

Until then, enjoy!

Please report [bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/Tablescript/tablescript.js/issues)! Please [join the Slack](https://tablescript.slack.com)! Please let me know any way you can if you're using Tablescript.js.

Cheers.
